 Since the new audio submission form is online, the displayed licensing terms of published audio files are some kind of weird, just stating that one "may not use this work for commercial purposes without making specific arrangements with the artist UNLESS â€¦" The original Creative Commons license is missing. Or is something wrong with the display my browser?
